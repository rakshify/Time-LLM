The Last Traded Price (LTP) is a crucial indicator in stock market analysis and algorithmic trading strategies. This dataset consists of 10 years of data from 50 stocks across the Indian market. To explore the granularity on the Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) problem, different subsets are created for each stock - one for 1-hour-level and one for 15-minutes-level, resulting in 100 files total. Each data point consists of the target value "LTP" and 5 market features (open, high, low, close, volume). The train/val/test split is 12/4/4 months, maintaining the same proportions as in standard benchmarks.
